Problems I ran into (P) , and how I solved them (S)

1
P: images didn't load when I opened my index page
S: I created a static and assets folder which my code was able to recognise to find and produce the images

2
P: Images wouldn't centre into three columns which I needed for my layout
S: I made a table where I was able to split the page into three and easily centre them using CSS

3
P: The user didn't know how many of each item they added to cart
S: Added an "amount" column with a value that increased by 1 after its corresponding item was added to cart

4
P: My code didn't recognise my database and couldn't transfer data
S: Created a new database, being careful not to make any mistakes

5
P: "Cart" page wouldn't respond to code in CSS file
S: Forgot to link the stylesheet in the Cart HTML file
